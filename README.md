### Implementation Status
- **Database Schema**: 15 tables with relationships and constraints
- **Entity Models**: 4 complete model classes with business logic
- **Data Access**: 4 complete DAO classes with full CRUD operations
- **Testing**: Integration test demonstrating all functionality
- **Configuration**: Maven build system and database connectivity
- **UI Layer**: Ready for Swing component development

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

* **Java 21** - Required for modern language features
* **Maven 3.9+** - Build and dependency management
* **MySQL 8.x** - Database server (optional for model testing)

### Option 1: Run Model Tests (No Database Required)

Test the complete business logic and model interactions without database setup:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd app

# Compile the project
mvn clean compile

# Run the integration test
java -cp target/classes org.bmc.app.test.SimpleModelTest
```

**Expected Output**: Complete demonstration of model interactions, business logic, validation, and entity relationships.

### Option 2: Full Database Setup

For complete functionality with database connectivity:

#### 1) Create Database
```bash
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE bmc_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;"
mysql -u root -p bmc_db < db/schema.sql
mysql -u root -p bmc_db < db/data.sql
```

#### 2) Configure Database Connection
Update `app/src/main/resources/application.properties`:

```properties
db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/bmc_db?useSSL=false&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true&serverTimezone=UTC
db.user=root
db.password=your_password
db.driver=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
```

#### 3) Build and Run
```bash
cd app
mvn clean compile
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.bmc.app.Main"
```

Or build executable JAR:
```bash
mvn clean package
java -jar target/bmc-app-1.0.0-shaded.jar
```

## Database Schema

The application includes a comprehensive 15-table database schema (in `db/schema.sql`):

### Core Business Tables:
* **Customer** - Customer information with contact details
* **Employee** - Staff with role-based permissions (restorer, fabricator, admin)
* **Job** - Work orders with status tracking and due dates
* **Invoice** - Billing with payment status and aging categories

### Supporting Tables:
* **Quote**, **Quote_Item** - Estimate system
* **Work_Log** - Time tracking for jobs
* **Service**, **Material**, **Job_Material** - Service and inventory management
* **Vendor**, **Purchase_Order**, **PO_Item** - Procurement system
* **Payment** - Payment history tracking

## Sample Business Queries

The `db/queries.sql` file includes 8 business intelligence queries:

```sql
-- 1. Jobs Due Soon (Next 7 Days)
SELECT j.job_id, c.name AS customer, j.due_date, j.status
FROM Job j JOIN Customer c ON c.customer_id = j.customer_id
WHERE j.status IN ('Planned','InProgress')
  AND j.due_date BETWEEN CURDATE() AND DATE_ADD(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY);

-- 2. Invoice Aging Report
SELECT c.name, i.total_amount, 
  DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), i.invoice_date) AS days_old,
  CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), i.invoice_date) <= 30 THEN 'Current'
       WHEN DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), i.invoice_date) <= 60 THEN '31-60 days'
       ELSE '61+ days' END as aging_category
FROM Invoice i JOIN Job j ON i.job_id = j.job_id 
JOIN Customer c ON j.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE i.paid = FALSE;

-- 3. Employee Workload Analysis
SELECT e.name, e.role, COUNT(w.log_id) as total_logs,
  SUM(w.hours_worked) as total_hours
FROM Employee e LEFT JOIN Work_Log w ON e.employee_id = w.employee_id
GROUP BY e.employee_id ORDER BY total_hours DESC;
```
